Description: The EQ-5D is a widely-used standarized instrument for measuring Health Related Quality Of Life (HRQOL), 
    developed by the EuroQol group <https://euroqol.org/>. It assesses five dimensions; mobility, self-care, 
    usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, using either a three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale.
    Scores from these dimensions are commonly converted into a single utility index using country-specific value sets, 
    which are critical in clinical and economic evaluations of healthcare and in population health surveys. 
    The eq5dsuite package enables users to calculate utility index values for the EQ-5D instruments, 
    including crosswalk utilities using the original crosswalk developed by van Hout et al. (2012) <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.02.008> 
    (mapping EQ-5D-5L responses to EQ-5D-3L index values), or the recently developed reverse crosswalk 
    by van Hout et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.jval.2021.03.009> (mapping EQ-5D-3L responses
    to EQ-5D-5L index values). Users are allowed to add and/or remove user-defined value sets. 
    Additionally, the package provides tools to analyze EQ-5D data according to the recommended 
    guidelines outlined in "Methods for Analyzing and Reporting EQ-5D data" by Devlin et al. (2020) <doi:10.1007/978-3-030-47622-9>.
